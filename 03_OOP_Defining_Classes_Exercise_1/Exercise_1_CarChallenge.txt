Exercise 1: Car Class

Komodo wants an app that will allow car objects to be created 
for their Car Insurance program.

Your tasks are as follows:

1.) Make a class that will allow us to easily create new Cars. 
For now we want some basics: car make, car model, and car year.

2.) In the Car class create a constructor that will allow us to easily 
create cars with all properties set.

3.) You will need to write Unit Tests for your properties.
